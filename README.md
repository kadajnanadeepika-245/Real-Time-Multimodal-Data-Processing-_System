# Real-Time-Multimodal-Data-Processing-_System

This project processes text, image, and audio data in real time using machine learning, enabling systems to understand and respond to multimodal inputs dynamically. It supports applications like smart surveillance, accessibility tools, and intelligent assistants by integrating diverse data for richer, context-aware interactions.
